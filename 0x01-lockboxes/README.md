# This function checks if all boxes in the given list of boxes can be unlocked, following these steps:

1. If the list of boxes is empty, return False.
2. Get the total number of boxes, `n`.
3. Initialize an empty set `visited` to keep track of visited boxes.
4. Initialize a queue with the starting box (box 0).
5. While the queue is not empty, pop the first box from the queue.
6. Add the current box to the visited set.
7. For each key in the current box's list of keys, if the key is within the valid range of boxes and it has not been visited yet, add it to the queue.
8. Repeat steps 5-7 until the queue is empty.
9. If the number of visited boxes is equal to `n`, return True, indicating that all boxes can be unlocked. Otherwise, return False.
